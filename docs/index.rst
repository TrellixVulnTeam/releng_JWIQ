Separate ``releng`` repository hosts various development-time scripts for
|Gromacs|.  Currently, this is used for build scripts on the Jenkins CI system,
but in the future, other scripts that do not have a strong connection to a
particular code version could also live here, as well as documentation that can
evolve separately from the source code (if not on the wiki).

.. TODO: Some more introductory text.
